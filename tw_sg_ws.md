# QR Codes – What Are They Are and How Do You Use Them?


## Overview

A QR code is an image with embedded data that can be scanned by another device – such as a smartphone – in order to perform a specific action.

Store image on your image server and adjust path/filename/extension if necessary. </span><br>(<a href="#">Back to top</a>)(<a href="#gdcalert2">Next alert</a>)<br><span style="color: red; font-weight: bold">>>>>> </span></p>

Whereas a standard barcode has a number of vertical black lines that need to be read by a special optical scanner, a QR code has data stored in two dimensions (vertically and horizontally). This, in addition to its ability to be read by many types of visual scanning devices, allows it to store more information and therefore have more flexibility in use.


## Background

QR (“Quick Read”) codes were developed by the Denso Wave company in Japan in order to quickly manage automotive part inventory. Denso Wave still owns the intellectual property to QR code design, but they allow it be used freely around the world, provided users adhere to ISO specifications for its design. These standards have been a big part of its successful adoption.


## QR Codes vs Barcodes

Think of QR codes as the successors to barcodes. They can do everything barcodes can do and more. Here’s a list of some of their advantages vs barcodes:


<table>
  <tr>
   <td><strong>QR Code</strong>
   </td>
   <td><strong>Barcode</strong>
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>More characters / more data
   </td>
   <td>Less characters / less data
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Can be read by various visual scanners
   </td>
   <td>Generally read only by special optical scanners
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Has built-in error checking (i.e. usable even when damaged)
   </td>
   <td>No error checking
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Can be dynamic (i.e. editable after creation)
   </td>
   <td>No dynamic versions
   </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
   <td>Can be used with artistic embellishment
   </td>
   <td>No artistic embellishment
   </td>
  </tr>
</table>



## Use Cases for QR Codes

This is where the simplicity of QR codes really shines. Because of the widespread adoption of mobile devices, QR codes are able to be accessed by most people. They allow the user to perform an action with a high certainty of success, along with providing performance metrics for the creator.

Some uses for QR codes are as follows:



* Linking to a specific URL - Creators are assured that users will go to the exact intended website.
* Joining a WiFi network - Admins have less problems with users accessing networks, especially at large institutions such as universities.
* Exchanging personal contact info - People can quickly share their contact info in a standard way such as the vCard format.
* Touchless environments - Businesses can provide info to customers such as menus during times when hygiene concerns are prevalent.
* App download link - Products can increase the likelihood that users will download a mobile app by providing a direct link.


## Note: Static vs Dynamic QR Codes

As mentioned above, QR codes can be **dynamic**. This means they will link to a short URL that can then redirect to a secondary location that is editable, giving creators the flexibility to keep content updated.

On the other hand, **static** QR codes have a fixed URL link embedded in their code that cannot be edited. They are useful when the creator knows they have a link or asset that will not change.

The main takeaway is to be aware that the two types of QR codes exist, and to choose the one that will best fit your purpose now and in the future.
