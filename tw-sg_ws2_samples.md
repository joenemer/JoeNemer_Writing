Title: “Manage AWS Credits in CloudCheckr”

AWS credits are billing credits earned by individual users or groups, but the challenge is that the vast majority of times these credits are allocated to a larger “supergroup” which can cause headaches for billing administrators.

After having been a Support/QA engineer and Technical Account Manager for 1.5 years, I had extensive experience guiding users through this frustrating issue and how to resolve it within CloudCheckr. I was the non-developer SME on this topic, and I also collaborated in-depth with the developers on the billing team who owned this part of the code. In order to explain to users what to expect, I would sit with the developers and review what the code did at every step. Occasionally we would dive together into actual code written in C#. I created the documentation in our licensed knowledge base platform, helpdocs.io.

Title: “Analyzing Your Reserved Instance Purchases”

I spent a good deal of time at CloudCheckr creating documentation around AWS billing, a topic that was endlessly confusing to enterprises and managed service providers. As mentioned above, I gained my AWS knowledge by working as a hybrid Support/QA engineer and a TAM. In this role I helped customers debug complex billing issues with insights from our billing team of developers.

The one thing that helped me understand users’ needs was the realization that AWS billing was challenging to everyone at all levels, and the billing problems that customers were trying to solve (such as how to invoice separate business units within an enterprise that uses shared prepaid infrastructure) were actually new, cutting edge problems that needed to be figured out on the spot.

Title: “Audyssey BassXT Electroacoustic Integration”

On the audio side of the world, I worked on an integration guide for a technology called BassXT that would allow small speakers to have as much clear and distortion-free bass as large speakers. As a technician who worked on testing of acoustics and speakers, I had to conduct numerous interviews with SMEs (research, hardware, and DSP engineers) in order to both fully understand the technology and create the right sort of documentation.

The purpose of the documentation was to ensure the successful implementation of a complicated technology suite. Audyssey Labs created a bass-enhancing technology that resulted in amazingly deep sound from small speakers. To accomplish this, the design of the entire electroacoustic system (i.e. the speaker, the enclosure, the amplifier, the DSP, and the power supply) had to be considered from the start. As well, manufacturing and testing standards had to be created in order to ensure a successful product. This document highlighted all of these areas. After completing this integration guide, I was next able to customize the implementation of this technology for prototypes and pre-sales demos.
